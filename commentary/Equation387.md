## Equation [387 `x ◇ y = (y ◇ y) ◇ x`](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?387): a law from MathOverflow
[This response by pastebee](https://mathoverflow.net/a/450905/766) to a [MathOverflow question](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/450890/is-there-an-identity-between-the-commutative-identity-and-the-constant-identity) established that there was an equational law strictly between the constant law 46 and the commutative law 43, namely Equation 387.
