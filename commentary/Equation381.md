## Equations [381 `x ◇ y = (x ◇ z) ◇ y`](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?381), [3722 `x ◇ y = (x ◇ y) ◇ (x ◇ y)`](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3722), [3744 `x ◇ y = (x ◇ z) ◇ (w ◇ y)`](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3744): 1978 Putnam laws
Problem A4 of the 1978 Putnam asked to show (in our language) that [Equation 3744 implies Equations 3722 and 381](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/implications-chapter.html#3744_implies_3722_381). This Putnam question referred to 3744 as a "bypass law".
