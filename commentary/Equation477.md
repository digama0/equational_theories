## Equation [477 `x = y ◇ (x ◇ (y ◇ (y ◇ y)))`](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?477): a confluent law
This law is a non-trivial example of a *confluent law*: a law in which every word has a unique shortest reduction using the law. This makes it possible to easily determine which other equations are implied by this law, giving anti-implications that were not obtainable by other means. See [this discussion](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Equation.20477).
