## Equation 5105 `x = y ◇ (y ◇ (y ◇ (x ◇ (z ◇ y))))`: A conjectural Austin law
An Austin law is a law which has infinite models, but no non-trivial finite models. [Kisielewicz showed](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0001.html#Kisielewicz2) that [this law has no non-trivial finite models](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/infinite-model-chapter.html#5105-nontrivial), but it remains open whether there is an infinite model.
