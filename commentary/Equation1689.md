## Equation [1689 `x = (y ◇ x) ◇ ((x ◇ z) ◇ z)`](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1689): a non-trivially singleton law
This law was [identified by Kisielewicz](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0001.html#Kisielewicz2) as a law that collapses to the singleton law 2, but all known proofs are [surprisingly lengthy](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/implications-chapter.html#1689_equiv_2).
